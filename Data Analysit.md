# Overview

Overview
As a software engineer, I am continually seeking opportunities to refine my skills in data analysis and software development. One of the goals in my journey is to build robust tools that can process and analyze data effectively, providing valuable insights. This project is a step towards gaining deeper expertise in Python, working with data analysis libraries, and creating software solutions that can handle real-world data for decision-making purposes.

Dataset Description
The dataset being analyzed contains sports performance data for various teams across multiple seasons. It includes important performance metrics such as win-loss percentage, total points scored, turnovers, rushing and passing yards, and other related statistics. The dataset allows for in-depth analysis of how different teams performed over time in various areas, and it can be used to identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses within each team. The data was obtained from a publicly available source and can be accessed through the link provided below.

Purpose of the Software
The purpose of writing this software is to create a tool that can automatically process and analyze sports performance data to extract meaningful insights. By developing this software, I aim to:

Practice working with data manipulation and analysis techniques using Python.
Build software that can generate actionable insights by processing raw data, such as identifying top-performing teams and analyzing key performance metrics like win-loss percentages and turnovers.
Gain experience in visualizing data with libraries such as Matplotlib, allowing users to quickly interpret the results through graphs and charts.

# Data Analysis Results


Question 1: Top Teams by Win-Loss Percentage:

The program calculates the average win-loss percentage for each team and displays the top 10 teams with the best win-loss percentages.

Question 2: Top Teams by Total Points Scored:

It calculates the total points scored by each team and ranks them, showing the teams with the most points scored.

Question 3: Top Teams by Turnover Percentage:

The software analyzes the turnover percentage for each team and identifies the teams with the highest turnover percentages.

# Future Work

* Automated Analysis:

It automates the process of analyzing sports performance, providing both numerical and visual insights in just a few steps.

* Insights for Decision-Making:

The software helps sports analysts, coaches, and team managers gain quick insights into team performance, which can be used for decision-making or strategy planning.

* Scalability:

The code is scalable. By modifying the dataset or adding more questions to the analysis, the software can be extended to accommodate more complex queries or additional metrics.
